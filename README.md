# Personal Website

[Link](https://wkhiro.github.io/) <br/><br/>
This is a single-page application (SPA) that I made in React using React Router. I've used ReactJS for a group project before, but wanted to use what I learned (and had yet to learn) about ReactJS to make my own website. Node.js was also used in order to utilize the packages provided by npm. I wanted to make my personal website a single-page application in order to make the website as fast as possible by cutting out all page reloading during website navigation. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Features

My personal website currently features:

### `Home`

A home page that gives visitors an overview about me.

### `Projects`

A page that contains links to projects I've worked on previously.

## Future Plans

I want to expand upon my website a bit more in the coming future with the following features:

- Make it a bit more dynamic and flashy. Add some animations maybe?
