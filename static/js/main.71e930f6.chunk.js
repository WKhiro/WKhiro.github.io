Besides granting some helpful armor and magic resistance, the passive of this item allows Riven to heal from inflicting ANY kind of damage, whether it be in the form of autoattacks or abilities. Since Riven can quickly chain together autoattacks and abilities, she can heavily abuse this passive. In addition, by having Death's Dance convert 30% of all damage you take into bleed damage, you effectively become tankier, since you don't immediately take as much damage as you would without this item. In the past, Riven's Valor (E) shield was on such a low cooldown that you could essentially tank all the bleed damage with your shield, making her an unkillable monster. However, with the nerfs to her shield cooldown, she isn't able to do this anymore. Thus, having some extra health (e.g. from Black Cleaver) is extremely useful so you don't just bleed to death.
